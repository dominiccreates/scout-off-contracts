## Contract change checklist

- [ ] New functions have unit tests covering the happy path and at least one error case
- [ ] Any new `DataKey` variant is documented with a comment
- [ ] Cross-contract calls are documented with a comment explaining the atomicity guarantee
- [ ] `ai.md` is updated if shared types, events, or env vars changed
- [ ] `docs/CONTRACT_REFERENCE.md` is updated with new functions

## Validator authorization changes

Changes to validator registration, revocation, or milestone approval logic require explicit
review from a second team member before merge — these are the trust anchors of the platform.
